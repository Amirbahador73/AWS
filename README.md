# ☁️ AWS Practice Scenarios: IAM, Lambda, EventBridge, and More

Welcome to my AWS practice repository! 🚀

This repo contains hands-on examples, experiments, and mini-projects I’ve built while learning **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. Each scenario is designed to help me understand and apply key cloud concepts using real services like:

- ✅ IAM (Identity and Access Management)
- ✅ AWS Lambda (Serverless functions)
- ✅ Amazon EventBridge (Event-based scheduling)
- ✅ AWS CLI and SDKs (Python `boto3`)
- ✅ Automation and security best practices

Whether you're a beginner exploring cloud or an experienced developer looking to automate AWS tasks, you'll find practical use cases here to learn from or build on.

## 📘 What You'll Find Here

- `lambda/` — Python Lambda functions (e.g., auto-detach IAM policy)
- `eventbridge/` — Scripts to create scheduled rules
- `policies/` — IAM role and permission examples
- `README.md` — Documentation for each scenario

## 🎯 Why I Created This Repo

I’m actively learning AWS and building up my cloud engineering and DevOps skills. This repo documents what I’ve practiced — both as a personal learning tool and to help others get started with real AWS workflows.

Feel free to fork, try, or suggest improvements!
